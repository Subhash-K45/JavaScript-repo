Day 1 -> Creating the add to cart button
Day 2 -> add features to like count button in the cart and function of remove button is done there
-> all the elements are wrapped inside the funcion wrap,when there is a need  we can call upon the function.
Day 3->Styling to it and make it more respnsive 
Image may take a time to fecth , hence there is a problem when adding to cart ,  problem is here this can be handled in the using react to load image faster
and async function can be used until the the image is fetched.
